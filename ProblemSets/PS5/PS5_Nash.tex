\section{PS5}
It was interesting to me that Bitcoin stocks are up again by 6 percent following its crash. This speaks to the volatility of the asset. I will use this data in a project for another class where I am measuring the risk of Bitcoin compared to the risk of benchmark portfolios or maket indexes. This is why I scraped the data I did for number 4. I am using several of these stocks in the benchmark portfolio. It was interesting to me how low monthly returns were for Amazon in some cases, as Amazon is blue chip and is growing.
