\section{Data Scraping}
I would be interested in scraping data from the UN, primarily about immigration. I would also like to scrape data from the NHL on player stats. I guess financial market data could be cool, but I don't want to be an investment banker because I don't want to die of a cocaine overdose.

\section{PS4 Questions}

1. The class of each is Data.Frame and SparkR, respectively.

2. It does not work because there is something that is not "inherent" to that class of dataframe--that class is probably a different type of data than what that command can read.

3. It does not work because of the same error message, so I would imagine the error occurred for the same reason.
