\section{Introduction}
My interests in economics and data science are distinct. I have been interested in economics since I read \textit{Intellectuals and Society} by Thomas Sowell in high school, an author with whom I fundamentally disagree but respect as an economist. My interests in economics are primarily political economy and theory. My interest in data science springs from the desire to strengthen a weakness--I am not particularly techy, and, while I might have theoretical and analytical skills, I have not learned many practical, marketable skills from the Economics Department. I see this as an opportunity to learn about something I never thought I would be interested in, and also to learn about something that might actually help me start a career. I chose to take this class because I thought it would help my proficiency in coding, especially Python, and teach me something useful. I am not entirely sure what is expected of the project for this class--I would like to choose a project that puts whatever skills I learn in here to use, and I still do not know exactly what skills I will learn. I hope to work as a consultant for a few years after I graduate and go to school for International Trade Law at some point.
