\section{PS8 Disaster}
In all honesty, this problem set was a mess. I couldn't get nloptr to install, and found that the issue I was running into for that was common on Windows and difficult to fix. I wrote the code anyway, and just didn't run the commands that required the nloptr package. I also couldn't get stargazer to work on the last regression in 9. I'm sure it's because I did something wrong in 4 but didn't have time to figure out what was going on. My estimates in 5 and 9 were very different from the "ground-truth" beta.

I wish I had been able to dedicate more time to this problem set.
